- 👋 Hi, I’m Warren
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and improving my knowledge of Python, with a specific focus on data analysis.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, preferrably Python projects or game development projects. 


I have spent a fair amount of time learning and practicing:
//  Advanced VBA (Mainly used for data analysis within ms excel),
LUA,
Python/Jupyter (with a focus on data analysis),
Django, Game development(Unity, GMS2, MonoGame),
C# (I could do with more practice),
SQL/mySQL

I am also proficient and installing small to medium networks/server infrastructure but I have not been certified. I learned these skills out of necessity rather than to try make money.
